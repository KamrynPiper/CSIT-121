 <p> Bee and Puppycat is an animated show featured on Netflix. It stars a mysterious girl and a confusing buddy she takes care of. <br> The two adventure across planets working temp jobs for some quick cash. I personally love the show and mark it as one of my THREE THINGS <br>because it is very relaxing, funny, colorful, and creative. Although it ends on an unending note, It's one of the few shows I do not mind rewatching! </p>
