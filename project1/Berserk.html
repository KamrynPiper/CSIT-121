<h1> Berserk </h1>


<p> Berserk is a manga that I recently started reading. Suprisingly, it is my very first manga that I've started. It depicts the story of one man who has overcome the most horrifying obstacles with <br>his rage and undeniable vengence towards those who have tormented him and the people he cared about. It is most definitely a book rated for adults, as its content gets very explicit in every volume you read. <br>I have already spent quite a lot of money on this series and plan to spend more!</p>
