      <h4> PLEASE NOTE ALL PREP STEP INFORMATION IS FROM: <a href= "https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/"> Tastes Better from Scratch </a></h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Separate whisked eggs into two separte bowls.</li>
    <li>Add 3/4 cup of sugar to the egg yolk bowl and mix until pale yellow. Then add 1/3 cup of milk and vanilla.</li>
     <li>Stir to combine, then pour egg yolk mixture into flower.</li>
    <li>Gently stir to combine but do not mix.</li>
    <li>Use electric beaters to beat the egg whites on high speed. As they begin to whip into stiff peaks, gradually mix in the remaining   1/4 cup of sugar. Fold the stiffly beaten egg whites into the batter gently, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl, until combined.</li>
    <li>Pour batter into pan and smooth it into an even layer. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes.Remove from the oven and allow cake to cool completely.</li>
<li>Combine the evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and whole milk in a small bowl. Once the cake has cooled use a fork to poke holes all over the top of the cake. </li>
<li>Slowly pour the milk mixture over the the top of the cake, making sure to pour near the edges and all around. Refrigerate the cake for at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
<li>Whip enough heavy cream to cover atop the cake. Once heavy whipping cream is spreaded, add a sprinkle of cinnamon and freshly slices strawberries on top.</li>

<h3>~Why This Recipe Is My Fave~</h3>
<p>This is my favorite recipe because it dives all the way down to how  to make a tres leches from scratch. My sister and I would make tres leches cakes for thanksgiving for our family, so it's always nostalgic. It's taste and texture is different but immaculate! </p>
